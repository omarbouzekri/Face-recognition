Real time face recognition program in Python using face_recognition, Opencv and numpy packages. I went through a three step process of gathering the images, encoding them and finally run the model to identify them.
## Prediction of variety of cryptocurrency prices
Prediction of variety of cryptocurrency prices in real time using LSTM neural network. I went through a five step process of getting real-time cryptocurrency data,
preparing data for training and testing, predicting the
