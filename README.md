## face recognition program
Real time face recognition program in Python using face_recognition, Opencv and numpy packages. I went through a three step process of gathering the images, encoding them and finally run the model to identify them.

Ps : If you can't download face_recognition libraries, you have to create a new virtual environment and then use pip install face_recognition
